### Hi there 👋

I'm Clayton Auld. By day, I work in telecommunications as a Network Capacity Forecasting Engineer (prior role was as a Radio Frequency (RF) Engineer). When I'm not at $DAYJOB, I dabble in open source home automation systems, Linux system administration, and network infrastructure. I manage several cloud VPSs using projects like [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net), secure DNS [(DNS-over-TLS)](https://github.com/clayauld/Secure-Adblocking-DNS), and other small things. I also run my own [UnRAID server](https://unraid.net) out of my closet for cloud storage and [home automation](https://home-assistant.io).

I am an open source software and hardware enthusiast, who loves to play with small embedded systems (think ESP32, STM32, Arduino, etc) for home automation. I believe access to free and open source software is crucial for our society and for the success of modern business and infrastructure.

I am an operational and board member of the **[Alaska Mountain Rescue Group (AMRG)](https://amrg.org)**, a non-profit volunteer organization providing mountain search and rescue services across Alaska.

### 🛠️ Featured Projects

I've been focusing on building tools for Search and Rescue (SAR) and remote communications:

- **[SAR-Respond](https://github.com/clayauld/sar-respond)**: A specialized response coordination system for rescue and response teams, designed to streamline communication and logistics during operations.
- **[Meshtopo](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo)**: A gateway to bridge Meshtastic off-grid LoRa networks to CalTopo maps, enabling real-time position tracking for teams in remote areas.
- **[SatCom Forecast](https://github.com/clayauld/satcom-forecast)**: A Home Assistant integration providing NOAA weather forecasts formatted specifically for satellite communicators (Garmin inReach, Zoleo, etc).
- **[Pandoc Markdown → PDF](https://github.com/clayauld/pandoc-md2pdf-web)**: A web interface and REST API to convert Markdown files to professional PDFs using Pandoc and XeLaTeX in Docker.

### 📝 Background

I am an avid user of Linux/GNU systems and love the WSL integration into Windows 10/11. Most of my GitHub work centers around home automation, Linux administration, and embedded systems. I have contributed to [SkiffOS](https://github.com/skiffos/SkiffOS), [Home Assistant HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), and [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish).
